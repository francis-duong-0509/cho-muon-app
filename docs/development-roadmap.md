## 8. Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| KYC provider API delays / cost | Medium | High | Use FPT.AI as primary, manual admin review as fallback |
| Cold start — no listings at launch | High | High | Seed 20-30 real listings with team/friends before launch |
| Chat infra complexity | Medium | Medium | Start with polling, upgrade to WebSocket when stable |
| Phase 1 timeline slip | Medium | Medium | Phase 1G (notifications/polish) can slip to post-launch |
| eKYC integration complexity | Medium | High | Build admin manual approval first, integrate eKYC API after |
| S3 storage cost | Low | Low | Compress images on upload, set lifecycle rules |
